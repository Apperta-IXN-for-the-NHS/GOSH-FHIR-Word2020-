# GOSH-FHIR-Word2020
The challenge of this project was to use synthetically generated data retrieved over FHIR from a GOSH gateway to generate documents prefilled with records. I developed a web application in Flask which uses a Python API for creating and updating Microsoft Word. I also used FHIR Parser which made it easier for me to access the information that I needed from HL7 FHIR.
